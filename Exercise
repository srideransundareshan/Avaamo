Git commands:
=============

1. How do you set up a script to run every time a repository receives new commits through push?

Ans: Every repository will have a hook attached to it. Those hooks are used to integrate the repo and actions performed on the repo's to other service or application.
Ex: Triggering a Jenkins Build when a push or release on the repo occurs.

Create an pre-push script under the cloned repo inside the .git/hooks/ and give the executable permission. So when ever a commit push happens the script is executed.

2. How do you find a list of files that have changed in a particular commit?

Ans: Any changes to a git repo is done via a commit. Each commit will have a unique commit id. Using the commit id one can check the files being altered by that commit.

git show --stat COMMIT ID

Monitoring using scripts:
=========================

1. Monitor a log file, detect a pattern detection, send an email on detection.

Ans: tail -fn1 /var/log/tomcat/catalina.out | grep "pattern" | mail -s "pattern match" example@gmail.com

2. Monitor process particular process on an instance, send an email on incase of state change like process got stopped, taking more CPU that threshold.

Ans:

#!/bin/bash
clear
pidsvc=$(systemctl status tomcat | awk ' /Main/ {print $3}')
if [[ $(systemctl status tomcat | awk ' /Active/ {print $3}' | tr -d '()') == running ]]
then
if [[ "$(top -bn 1  | grep -i $pidsvc | awk '{print $9}'|cut -f 1 -d ".")" -ge 10  ]]
then
LOAD=$(top -bn 1  | grep -i $pidsvc | awk '{print $9}'|cut -f 1 -d ".")
echo running with high load of $LOAD | mail -s "svc alert" example@gmail.com
else
LOAD=$(top -bn 1  | grep -i $pidsvc | awk '{print $9}'|cut -f 1 -d ".")
echo running with regular load of $LOAD | mail -s "svc alert" example@gmail.com
fi
else
echo "not running" | mail -s "svc alert" example@gmail.com
fi

Security:
=========

1. Show how to block ports.

Ans:

/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j DROP

/sbin/service iptables save

2. Show how to setup port forwarding.

Ans:

/sbin/iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-port 80

/sbin/service iptables save

Network:
========

1. Show list of processes using the network.

Ans: netstat --inet -np

2. Show the list of IPs a process is connected to.

Ans: netstat -pn  | grep -i java | awk '{print $5}' | head -n -3 | cut -d ":" -f1

3. Show how to list open files and kill processes tied to a user.

Ans:

To list open files of a user: lsof -u "username"

To kill the process tied to a user: kill -9 $(lsof -t -u username)

Code:
=====
Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line. For each multiple of 3, print "AVA" instead of the number.
For each multiple of 5, print "AMO" instead of the number.

For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "AVAAMO" instead of the number.


Ans:

for ((i=1;i<=30;i++)); do echo "$i"; done |  sed -E '0~3s/[0-9]+/AVA/; 0~5s/[0-9]+/AMO/; 0~15s/AVA/AVAAMO/'
